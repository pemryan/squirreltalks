# Introduction #

The purpose of this work is to help squirrels benefit from computer technologies. I'll try to develop a tool that can connect two squirrels remotely via the web. The final goal may be: You can telephone the squirrel lived near your house when you get up at one moroning and tell it that it appeared in your dream at last night.
